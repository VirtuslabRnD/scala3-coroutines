## The `scala.compiletime` Package

The [`scala.compiletime`](https://dotty.epfl.ch/api/scala/compiletime.html) package contains helper definitions that provide support for compile-time operations over values. They are described in the following.

### `constValue` and `constValueOpt`

`constValue` is a function that produces the constant value represented by a
type.

```scala
import scala.compiletime.constValue
import scala.compiletime.ops.int.S

transparent inline def toIntC[N]: Int =
  inline constValue[N] match
    case 0        => 0
    case _: S[n1] => 1 + toIntC[n1]

inline val ctwo = toIntC[2]
```

`constValueOpt` is the same as `constValue`, however returning an `Option[T]`
enabling us to handle situations where a value is not present. Note that `S` is
the type of the successor of some singleton type. For example the type `S[1]` is
the singleton type `2`.

### `erasedValue`

So far we have seen inline methods that take terms (tuples and integers) as
parameters. What if we want to base case distinctions on types instead? For
instance, one would like to be able to write a function `defaultValue`, that,
given a type `T`, returns optionally the default value of `T`, if it exists.
We can already express this using rewrite match expressions and a simple
helper function, `scala.compiletime.erasedValue`, which is defined as follows:

```scala
def erasedValue[T]: T
```

The `erasedValue` function _pretends_ to return a value of its type argument `T`.
Calling this function will always result in a compile-time error unless the call
is removed from the code while inlining.

Using `erasedValue`, we can then define `defaultValue` as follows:

```scala
import scala.compiletime.erasedValue

inline def defaultValue[T] =
  inline erasedValue[T] match
    case _: Byte    => Some(0: Byte)
    case _: Char    => Some(0: Char)
    case _: Short   => Some(0: Short)
    case _: Int     => Some(0)
    case _: Long    => Some(0L)
    case _: Float   => Some(0.0f)
    case _: Double  => Some(0.0d)
    case _: Boolean => Some(false)
    case _: Unit    => Some(())
    case _          => None
```

Then:

```scala
val dInt: Some[Int] = defaultValue[Int]
val dDouble: Some[Double] = defaultValue[Double]
val dBoolean: Some[Boolean] = defaultValue[Boolean]
val dAny: None.type = defaultValue[Any]
```

As another example, consider the type-level version of `toInt` below:
given a _type_ representing a Peano number,
return the integer _value_ corresponding to it.
Consider the definitions of numbers as in the _Inline
Match_ section above. Here is how `toIntT` can be defined:

```scala
transparent inline def toIntT[N <: Nat]: Int =
  inline scala.compiletime.erasedValue[N] match
    case _: Zero.type => 0
    case _: Succ[n] => toIntT[n] + 1

inline val two = toIntT[Succ[Succ[Zero.type]]]
```

`erasedValue` is an `erased` method so it cannot be used and has no runtime
behavior. Since `toIntT` performs static checks over the static type of `N` we
can safely use it to scrutinize its return type (`S[S[Z]]` in this case).

### `error`

The `error` method is used to produce user-defined compile errors during inline expansion.
It has the following signature:

```scala
inline def error(inline msg: String): Nothing
```

If an inline expansion results in a call `error(msgStr)` the compiler
produces an error message containing the given `msgStr`.

```scala
import scala.compiletime.{error, code}

inline def fail() =
  error("failed for a reason")

fail() // error: failed for a reason
```

or

```scala
inline def fail(p1: => Any) =
  error(code"failed on: $p1")

fail(identity("foo")) // error: failed on: identity("foo")
```

### The `scala.compiletime.ops` package

The [`scala.compiletime.ops`](https://dotty.epfl.ch/api/scala/compiletime/ops.html) package contains types that provide support for
primitive operations on singleton types. For example,
`scala.compiletime.ops.int.*` provides support for multiplying two singleton
`Int` types, and `scala.compiletime.ops.boolean.&&` for the conjunction of two
`Boolean` types. When all arguments to a type in `scala.compiletime.ops` are
singleton types, the compiler can evaluate the result of the operation.

```scala
import scala.compiletime.ops.int.*
import scala.compiletime.ops.boolean.*

val conjunction: true && true = true
val multiplication: 3 * 5 = 15
```

Many of these singleton operation types are meant to be used infix (as in [SLS ยง3.2.10](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.13/03-types.html#infix-types)).

Since type aliases have the same precedence rules as their term-level
equivalents, the operations compose with the expected precedence rules:

```scala
import scala.compiletime.ops.int.*
val x: 1 + 2 * 3 = 7
```

The operation types are located in packages named after the type of the
left-hand side parameter: for instance, `scala.compiletime.ops.int.+` represents
addition of two numbers, while `scala.compiletime.ops.string.+` represents string
concatenation. To use both and distinguish the two types from each other, a
match type can dispatch to the correct implementation:

```scala
import scala.compiletime.ops.*

import scala.annotation.infix

type +[X <: Int | String, Y <: Int | String] = (X, Y) match
  case (Int, Int) => int.+[X, Y]
  case (String, String) => string.+[X, Y]

val concat: "a" + "b" = "ab"
val addition: 1 + 1 = 2
```

## Summoning Implicits Selectively

It is foreseen that many areas of typelevel programming can be done with rewrite
methods instead of implicits. But sometimes implicits are unavoidable. The
problem so far was that the Prolog-like programming style of implicit search
becomes viral: Once some construct depends on implicit search it has to be
written as a logic program itself. Consider for instance the problem of creating
a `TreeSet[T]` or a `HashSet[T]` depending on whether `T` has an `Ordering` or
not. We can create a set of implicit definitions like this:

```scala
trait SetFor[T, S <: Set[T]]

class LowPriority:
  implicit def hashSetFor[T]: SetFor[T, HashSet[T]] = ...

object SetsFor extends LowPriority:
  implicit def treeSetFor[T: Ordering]: SetFor[T, TreeSet[T]] = ...
```

Clearly, this is not pretty. Besides all the usual indirection of implicit
search, we face the problem of rule prioritization where we have to ensure that
`treeSetFor` takes priority over `hashSetFor` if the element type has an
ordering. This is solved (clumsily) by putting `hashSetFor` in a superclass
`LowPriority` of the object `SetsFor` where `treeSetFor` is defined. Maybe the
boilerplate would still be acceptable if the crufty code could be contained.
However, this is not the case. Every user of the abstraction has to be
parameterized itself with a `SetFor` implicit. Considering the simple task _"I
want a `TreeSet[T]` if `T` has an ordering and a `HashSet[T]` otherwise"_, this
seems like a lot of ceremony.

There are some proposals to improve the situation in specific areas, for
instance by allowing more elaborate schemes to specify priorities. But they all
keep the viral nature of implicit search programs based on logic programming.

By contrast, the new `summonFrom` construct makes implicit search available
in a functional context. To solve the problem of creating the right set, one
would use it as follows:

```scala
import scala.compiletime.summonFrom

inline def setFor[T]: Set[T] = summonFrom {
  case ord: Ordering[T] => new TreeSet[T](using ord)
  case _                => new HashSet[T]
}
```

A `summonFrom` call takes a pattern matching closure as argument. All patterns
in the closure are type ascriptions of the form `identifier : Type`.

Patterns are tried in sequence. The first case with a pattern `x: T` such that an implicit value of type `T` can be summoned is chosen.

Alternatively, one can also use a pattern-bound given instance, which avoids the explicit using clause. For instance, `setFor` could also be formulated as follows:

```scala
import scala.compiletime.summonFrom

inline def setFor[T]: Set[T] = summonFrom {
  case given Ordering[T] => new TreeSet[T]
  case _                 => new HashSet[T]
}
```

`summonFrom` applications must be reduced at compile time.

Consequently, if we summon an `Ordering[String]` the code above will return a
new instance of `TreeSet[String]`.

```scala
summon[Ordering[String]]

println(setFor[String].getClass) // prints class scala.collection.immutable.TreeSet
```

**Note** `summonFrom` applications can raise ambiguity errors. Consider the following
code with two givens in scope of type `A`. The pattern match in `f` will raise
an ambiguity error of `f` is applied.

```scala
class A
given a1: A = new A
given a2: A = new A

inline def f: Any = summonFrom {
  case given _: A => ???  // error: ambiguous givens
}
```

## `summonInline`

The shorthand `summonInline` provides a simple way to write a `summon` that is delayed until the call is inlined.
Unlike `summonFrom`, `summonInline` also yields the implicit-not-found error, if a given instance of the summoned
type is not found.
```scala
import scala.compiletime.summonInline
import scala.annotation.implicitNotFound

@implicitNotFound("Missing One")
trait Missing1

@implicitNotFound("Missing Two")
trait Missing2

trait NotMissing
given NotMissing = ???

transparent inline def summonInlineCheck[T <: Int](inline t : T) : Any =
  inline t match
    case 1 => summonInline[Missing1]
    case 2 => summonInline[Missing2]
    case _ => summonInline[NotMissing]

val missing1 = summonInlineCheck(1) // error: Missing One
val missing2 = summonInlineCheck(2) // error: Missing Two
val notMissing : NotMissing = summonInlineCheck(3)
```
