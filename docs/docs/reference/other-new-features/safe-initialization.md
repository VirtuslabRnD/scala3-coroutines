title: "Safe Initialization"
---

Scala 3 implements experimental safe initialization check, which can be enabled by the compiler option `-Ysafe-init`.

## A Quick Glance

To get a feel of how it works, we first show several examples below.

### Parent-Child Interaction

Given the following code snippet:

``` scala
abstract class AbstractFile:
  def name: String
  val extension: String = name.substring(4)

class RemoteFile(url: String) extends AbstractFile:
  val localFile: String = s"${url.##}.tmp"  // error: usage of `localFile` before it's initialized
  def name: String = localFile
```

The checker will report:

``` scala
-- Warning: tests/init/neg/AbstractFile.scala:7:4 ------------------------------
7 |	val localFile: String = s"${url.##}.tmp"  // error: usage of `localFile` before it's initialized
  |	    ^
  |    Access non-initialized field value localFile. Calling trace:
  |     -> val extension: String = name.substring(4)	[ AbstractFile.scala:3 ]
  |      -> def name: String = localFile            	[ AbstractFile.scala:8 ]
```

### Inner-Outer Interaction

Given the code below:

``` scala
object Trees:
  class ValDef { counter += 1 }
  class EmptyValDef extends ValDef
  val theEmptyValDef = new EmptyValDef
  private var counter = 0  // error
```

The checker will report:

``` scala
-- Warning: tests/init/neg/trees.scala:5:14 ------------------------------------
5 |  private var counter = 0  // error
  |              ^
  |             Access non-initialized field variable counter. Calling trace:
  |              -> val theEmptyValDef = new EmptyValDef    [ trees.scala:4 ]
  |               -> class EmptyValDef extends ValDef       [ trees.scala:3 ]
  |                -> class ValDef { counter += 1 }	     [ trees.scala:2 ]
```

### Functions

Given the code below:

``` scala
abstract class Parent:
  val f: () => String = () => this.message
  def message: String

class Child extends Parent:
  val a = f()
  val b = "hello"           // error
  def message: String = b
```

The checker reports:

``` scala
-- Warning: tests/init/neg/features-high-order.scala:7:6 -----------------------
7 |  val b = "hello"           // error
  |      ^
  |Access non-initialized field value b. Calling trace:
  | -> val a = f()                              	[ features-high-order.scala:6 ]
  |   -> val f: () => String = () => this.message	[ features-high-order.scala:2 ]
  |    -> def message: String = b	                [ features-high-order.scala:8 ]
```
## Design Goals

We establish the following design goals:

- __Sound__: checking always terminates, and is sound for common and reasonable usage (over-approximation)
- __Expressive__: support common and reasonable initialization patterns
- __Friendly__: simple rules, minimal syntactic overhead, informative error messages
- __Modular__: modular checking, no analysis beyond project boundary
- __Fast__: instant feedback
- __Simple__: no changes to core type system, explainable by a simple theory

By _reasonable usage_, we include the following use cases (but not restricted to them):

- Access fields on `this` and outer `this` during initialization
- Call methods on `this` and outer `this` during initialization
- Instantiate inner class and call methods on such instances during initialization
- Capture fields in functions

## Principles

To achieve the goals, we uphold three fundamental principles:
_stackability_, _monotonicity_ and _scopability_.

Stackability means that all fields of a class are initialized at the end of the
class body. Scala enforces this property in syntax by demanding that all fields
are initialized at the end of the primary constructor, except for the language
feature below:

``` scala
var x: T = _
```

Control effects such as exceptions may break this property, as the
following example shows:

``` scala
class MyException(val b: B) extends Exception("")
class A:
  val b = try { new B } catch { case myEx: MyException => myEx.b }
  println(b.a)

class B:
  throw new MyException(this)
  val a: Int = 1
```

In the code above, the control effect teleport the uninitialized value
wrapped in an exception. In the implementation, we avoid the problem
by ensuring that the values that are thrown must be transitively initialized.

Monotonicity means that the initialization status of an object should
not go backward: initialized fields continue to be initialized, a
field points to an initialized object may not later point to an
object under initialization. As an example, the following code will be rejected:

``` scala
trait Reporter:
  def report(msg: String): Unit

class FileReporter(ctx: Context) extends Reporter:
  ctx.typer.reporter = this                // ctx now reaches an uninitialized object
  val file: File = new File("report.txt")
  def report(msg: String) = file.write(msg)
```

In the code above, suppose `ctx` points to a transitively initialized
object. Now the assignment at line 3 makes `this`, which is not fully
initialized, reachable from `ctx`. This makes field usage dangerous,
as it may indirectly reach uninitialized fields.

Monotonicity is based on a well-known technique called _heap monotonic
typestate_ to ensure soundness in the presence of aliasing
[1]. Roughly speaking, it means initialization state should not go backwards.

Scopability means that there are no side channels to access to partially constructed objects. Control effects like coroutines, delimited
control, resumable exceptions may break the property, as they can transport a
value upper in the stack (not in scope) to be reachable from the current scope.
Static fields can also serve as a teleport thus breaks this property.  In the
implementation, we need to enforce that teleported values are transitively
initialized.

The principles enable _local reasoning_ of initialization, which means:

> An initialized environment can only produce initialized values.

For example, if the arguments to an `new`-expression are transitively
initialized, so is the result. If the receiver and arguments in a method call
are transitively initialized, so is the result.

## Rules

With the established principles and design goals, following rules are imposed:

1. In an assignment `o.x = e`, the expression `e` may only point to transitively initialized objects.

   This is how monotonicity is enforced in the system. Note that in an
   initialization `val f: T = e`, the expression `e` may point to an object
   under initialization. This requires a distinction between mutation and
   initialization in order to enforce different rules. Scala
   has different syntax for them, it thus is not an issue.

2. References to objects under initialization may not be passed as arguments to method calls or constructors.

   Escape of `this` in the constructor is commonly regarded as an
   anti-pattern, and it's rarely used in practice. This rule is simple
   for the programmer to reason about initialization and it simplifies
   implementation. The theory supports safe escape of `this` with the help of
   annotations, we delay the extension until there is a strong need.

3. Local definitions may only refer to transitively initialized objects.

   It means that in a local definition `val x: T = e`, the expression `e` may
   only evaluate to transitively initialized objects. The same goes for local
   lazy variables and methods. This rule is again motivated for simplicity in
   reasoning about initialization: programmers may safely assume that all local
   definitions only point to transitively initialized objects.

## Modularity

The analysis takes the primary constructor of concrete classes as entry points.
It follows the constructors of super classes, which might be defined in another project.
The analysis takes advantage of TASTy for analyzing super classes defined in another project.

The crossing of project boundary raises a concern about modularity. It is
well-known in object-oriented programming that superclass and subclass are
tightly coupled. For example, adding a method in the superclass requires
recompiling the child class for checking safe overriding.

Initialization is no exception in this respect. The initialization of an object
essentially invovles close interaction between subclass and superclass. If the
superclass is defined in another project, the crossing of project boundary
cannot be avoided for soundness of the analysis.

Meanwhile, inheritance across project boundary has been under scrutiny and the
introduction of [open classes](./open-classes.html) mitigate the concern here.
For example, the initialization check could enforce that the constructors of
open classes may not contain method calls on `this` or introduce annotations as
a contract.

The feedback from the community on the topic is welcome.

## Back Doors

Occasionally you may want to suppress warnings reported by the
checker.  You can either write `e: @unchecked` to tell the checker to
skip checking for the expression `e`, or you may use the old trick:
mark some fields as lazy.

## Caveats

- The system cannot provide safety guarantee when extending Java or Scala 2 classes.
- Safe initialization of global objects is only partially checked.
