# Dotty: This test has been disabled because super accessors are introduced
# in PostTyper but the sbt phase is run before PostTyper so that tests like
# "constants" succeed.

# This test verifies that adding/removing calls to super in traits properly
# recompiles subclasses.  super calls introduce accessors that are not in
# the public API, so this is not picked up by the usual API change detection.
