# Recompile B (no meaningful change, this is just so that the dependency on A.InnerObject are
# recorded using the `binaryDependency` sbt callback, which will only work correctly
# if we call it with the inner object binary name and not the top-level class name).

# Change the signature of A.Inner#foo, this requires B to be recompiled,
